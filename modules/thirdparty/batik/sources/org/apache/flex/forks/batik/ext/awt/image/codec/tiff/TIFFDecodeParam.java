/**
 * An instance of <code>ImageDecodeParam</code> for decoding images in
 * the TIFF format.
 *
 * <p> To determine the number of images present in a TIFF file, use
 * the <code>getNumPages()</code> method on the
 * <code>ImageDecoder</code> object that will be used to perform the
 * decoding.  The desired page number may be passed as an argument to
 * the <code>ImageDecoder.decodeAsRaster)()</code> or
 * <code>decodeAsRenderedImage()</code> methods.
 *
 * <p> For TIFF Palette color images, the colorMap always has entries
 * of short data type, the color Black being represented by 0,0,0 and
 * White by 65536,65536,65536. In order to display these images, the
 * default behavior is to dither the short values down to 8 bits.
 * The dithering is done by calling the <code>decode16BitsTo8Bits</code>
 * method for each short value that needs to be dithered. The method has
 * the following implementation:
 * <code>
 *       byte b;
 *       short s;
 *       s = s & 0xffff;
 *       b = (byte)((s >> 8) & 0xff);
 * </code>
 * If a different algorithm is to be used for the dithering, this class
 * should be subclassed and an appropriate implementation should be
 * provided for the <code>decode16BitsTo8Bits</code> method in the subclass.
 *
 * <p>If the palette contains image data that is signed short, as specified
 * by the SampleFormat tag, the dithering is done by calling
 * <code>decodeSigned16BitsTo8Bits</code> instead. The method has the
 * following implementation:
 * <code>
 *       byte b;
 *       short s;
 *       b = (byte)((s + Short.MIN_VALUE) >> 8);
 * </code>
 * In order to use a different algorithm for the dithering, this class
 * should be subclassed and the method overridden.
 *
 * <p> If it is desired that the Palette be decoded such that the output
 * image is of short data type and no dithering is performed, the
 * <code>setDecodePaletteAsShorts</code> method should be used.
 *
 * <p><b> This class is not a committed part of the JAI API.  It may
 * be removed or changed in future releases of JAI.</b>
 *
