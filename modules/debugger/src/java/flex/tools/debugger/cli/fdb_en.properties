# Translation:
#
# In this file, a couple of messages are split across multiple lines.  The main
# reason for that is that fdb is a command-line program, so we prefer to keep
# messages at less than 80 characters so that they fit in a typical command
# window.  When translating strings, you can either keep the line breaks in the
# same places, or move them, or even remove them altogether if a message will
# fit on a single line.
