<BODY>

This package contains the node classes that the MXML Parser uses to
build the initial DOM for each MXML document.  These nodes are not
fully type aware.  For example, components are represented by generic
instances of Node.  Only tags, which can be resolved to a type at
parse time, are represented by more type aware nodes, like ArrayNode,
HTTPServiceNode, and XMLNode.
