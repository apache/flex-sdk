# If you chose to use this file rename it to env.properties and uncomment the
# properties you wish to set.

# For each of
#
#   AIR_HOME
#   FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER
#   PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME
#
# you need to set an environment variable with that name or set the property here
# prefixed with "env.".  If a property is set in this file, and the corresponding 
# environment variable is also set, the property set here takes precedence over the 
# corresponding environment variable.
#
# Use absolute file paths. 
# 
# This is a Java property file.  On Windows if you use the '\' file 
# separator you must use "\\", for example,
#
#       env.FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER=z:\\tools\\player\\flashplayer_11_sa_debug_32bit.exe
#
# See the README file for more information about the different variables.

#
# Set this to the directory that contains the unzipped Adobe AIR SDK for your
# platform.
#
#env.AIR_HOME=

#
# Set this to file that contains the Adobe Flash Player content debugger
# for your platform.  
#
#env.FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER=

#
# Set this to the directory that contains the Adobe Flash Player playerglobal.swc.
