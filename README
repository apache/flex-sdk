Apache Flex (Flex)
==================

    Apache Flex is an application framework for easily building Flash-based applications 
    for mobile devices, the browser and desktop.
    
    For detailed information about Apache Flex please visit 
    http://incubator.apache.org/flex/

    Apache Flex is a large project with many pieces.  The framework is implemented
    in Actionscript and the compiler is implemented in Java.

    Currently supported platforms include:

        Microsoft Windows
        Mac OS X
        Apple iOS
        Google Android
        RIM BlackBerry

    Apache Flex is the software evolution of the popular Adobe Flex SDK project.
    
    The community surrounding Flex is vast, diverse, distributed globally, and with all 
    levels of proficiency in software development. It is estimated that there are between 
    350,000 and 500,000 Flex developers worldwide. 

Getting the latest sources via Subversion
=========================================

    You can always checkout the latest source via subversion using the following
    command:

    svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/flex/trunk flex

    For further information visit http://incubator.apache.org/flex/source.html
    
Building Apache Flex 4.9
========================

    Apache Flex 4.9 is a follow up release to Apache Flex 4.8.  Apache Flex 4.8 which was 
    a parity release from Apache of Adobe Flex 4.6.
    
    Apache Flex is a large project. It requires some build tools which must be installed
    prior to building Flex and it depends on some external software which
    are downloaded as part of the build process.  See the Software Dependencies
    section for more information on the external software dependencies.
    
    From Apache's perspective, the Adobe Flash Player and Adobe AIR have excluded
    licenses so they can not be bundled with the Apache Flex binaries.  They must be
    installed prior to building Apache Flex.
    
Install Prerequisites
---------------------

    Adobe Flex 4.6 was certified with AIR 3.1 and Flash Player 11.1.  Apache Flex 4.9
    will continue to use these.  Apache Flex 4.9 has been upgraded to use Text Layout
    Format (TLF) 3.0.33 which is now part of Apache Flex.

    Before building Flex you must install the following software and set the
    corresponding environment variables using absolute file paths.  Relative file paths
    will result in build errors.
	
	The environment variables PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME, AIR_HOME, FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER,
	PIXELBENDER_HOME and ADOBE_EXTENSION_MANAGER can also be set in the property file 
	called env.properties. See the env-template.properties file for instructions.
    
    The Adobe Flash Player playerglobal.swc is needed to compile all the components
    with the exception of the airframework and airspark components which require
    airglobal.swc from the AIR Integration Kit.  The AIR Integration kit is also needed
    to build and debug mobile applications.  The Flash Player content debugger is
    used by checkintests and other pieces of the test subsystem to run compiled
    applications.  The Adobe Pixel Bender Toolkit is needed to build some
    files needed for effects.
    
    ==================================================================================
    SOFTWARE                                    ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE (absolute paths)
    ==================================================================================
    
    Java SDK 1.6 or greater (*1)                JAVA_HOME
        (for Java 1.7 see note at (*2))
        
    Ant 1.7.1 or greater (*1)                   ANT_HOME
        (for Java 1.7 see note at (*2))
        
    Cygwin, git bash 
    or other unix-like shell
    (if Windows)
    
    Adobe AIR Integration Kit (*3)              AIR_HOME 
    
    Adobe Flash Player Content Debugger (*4)    FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER
        
    Adobe Pixel Bender Toolkit (*5)             PIXELBENDER_HOME
    
    Adobe Flash Player (*6)                     PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME

    Adobe Extension Manager CS5 (*7)            ADOBE_EXTENSION_MANAGER

    ==================================================================================
        
    *1) The bin directories for ANT_HOME and JAVA_HOME should be added to your PATH.
        
        On Windows, set PATH to
            
            PATH=%PATH%;%ANT_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin
            
        On the Mac (bash), set PATH to
            
            export PATH="$PATH:$ANT_HOME/bin:$JAVA_HOME/bin"

    *2)  If you are using Java SDK 1.7 or greater on a Mac you must use Ant 1.8 or 
         greater. If you use Java 1.7 with Ant 1.7, ant reports the java version as 1.6 
         so the JVM args for the data model (-d32/-d64) will not be set correctly and you
         will get compile errors.
        
    *3) The Adobe AIR integration kit for Windows can be downloaded from:
                http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/win/download/3.4/AdobeAIRSDK.zip
        
         The Adobe AIR integration kit for Mac can be downloaded from:
            http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/mac/download/3.4/AdobeAIRSDK.tbz2
        
        Download the AIR SDK for your platform and unzip it.  Set AIR_HOME to the absolute 
        path of the AIR SDK directory.
               
    *4) The Adobe Flash Player content debuggers can be found here:
            http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html
            
        On Windows, set FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER to the absolute path of FlashPlayerDebugger.exe
        
        On the Mac, set FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER to the absolute path of 
        Flash Player Debugger.app/Contents/MacOS/Flash Player Debugger
        
        On Linux, set set FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER to the absolute path of flashplayerdebugger
            
    *5) The Adobe Pixel Bender Toolkit for Windows can be downloaded from:
            http://www.adobe.com/go/pixelbender_toolkit_zip/
        
         The Adobe Pixel Bender Toolkit for Mac can be downloaded from:
            http://www.adobe.com/go/pixelbender_toolkit_dmg/
        
        Download the Pixel Bender Toolkit for your platform and install or unzip it.
	    Set PIXELBENDER_HOME to the absolute path of the Pixel Bender Toolkit directory.

    *6) The Adobe Flash Player playerglobal.swc for 11.1 can be downloaded from:
            http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_1.swc 
        
        Use URL above to download playerglobal11_1.swc. Create the directory, player/11.1
        and copy playerglobal11_1.swc to player/11.1/playerglobal.swc.
        
        Other more recent versions of Adode Flash Player playergloal.swc can be downloaded from:
       		http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_2.swc
        	http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_3.swc
       		http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_4.swc
        	http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/updaters/11/playerglobal11_5.swc
        	
        These can be used with Apache Flex but have not been fully tested.
        
        Set PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME to the absolute path of the player directory (not including
		the version subdirectory). The target-version option controls which 
		PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME subdirectory is used.

    *7) The Adobe Extension Manager is only required for those creating release or testing
            changes to the flash-integration swc.  Not that if you change APIs on classes
            that flash-integration depends on, you may need to update flash-integration.

        The Adobe Extension Manager for Windows can be downloaded from:
            http://download.macromedia.com/pub/dw_exchange/extension_manager/win/AdobeExtensionManager5All.zip

        On the Mac, set ADOBE_EXTENSION_MANAGER to the absolute path of "Adobe Extension Manager CS5.app"

FlashPlayer Configuration
-------------------------

    For testing, the Flash Player's mm.cfg file must have the following entries
    
        ErrorReportingEnable=1
        TraceOutputFileEnable=1
    
    and a FlashPlayerTrust file must allow local SWFs to access local files.

Using the Binary Distribution
-----------------------------

    You must download the thirdparty dependencies.

    When you have all the prerequisites in place and the environment variables set, 
    (see Install Prerequisites above), use

        cd <flex.dir>/frameworks
        ant thirdparty-downloads
    
Building the Framework in a Binary Distribution
-----------------------------------------------

    The source for most of the framework is included in the binary distribution.  
    It can be useful if you wish to debug and/or extend components.

    When you have all the prerequisites in place and the environment variables set, 
    (see Install Prerequisites above), use

        cd <flex.dir>/frameworks
        ant main        (or just ant since the default target is main)
    
    to download the thirdparty dependencies and build the Flex framework.  You may be 
    prompted to acknowledge some of the downloads.  Since the third-party dependencies 
    take a little while to download and they don't change very often, they are not 
    cleaned with the regular clean target.
    
    To clean the build, of everything other than the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
    
        ant clean 
    
    To clean the build, of everything, including the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
        
        ant super-clean (which is just thirdparty-clean followed by clean)

Building the Source in the Source Distribution
----------------------------------------------

    The source for both the Flex compiler and the Flex framework is included in the
    source distribution.  The compiler is in the modules directory and the framework
    is in the frameworks directory.
    
    When you have all the prerequisites in place and the environment variables set
    (see Install Prerequisites above), use

        cd <flex.dir>
        ant main        (or just ant since the default target is main)
    
    to download the thirdparty dependencies and build the source.  You may be prompted
    to acknowledge and/or confirm some of the downloads.  Since the third-party 
    dependencies take a little while to download and they don't change very often, they 
    are not cleaned with the regular clean target.
    
    If you would like to build the RSLs, use
    
        ant frameworks-rsls
        
    To clean the build, of everything other than the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
    
        ant clean 
    
    To clean the build, of everything, including the downloaded third-party dependencies 
    use
        
        ant super-clean (which is just thirdparty-clean followed by clean)
        
    To generate a source distribution package and a binary distribution package use
        
        ant -Dbuild.number=<last svn rev> -Dbuild.noprompt=  release

    The packages can be found in the "out" subdirectory.
            
    To build the ASDoc package
        
        ant asdoc-package

    To get a brief listing of all the targets type
    
        ant -projecthelp


Thanks for using Apache Flex.
