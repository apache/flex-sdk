Install Prerequisites
=====================

	Mustella requires some variables set: AIR_HOME, FLASHPLAYER_DEBUGGER, PLAYERGLOBAL_HOME, and ANT_HOME. Use absolute file paths
	when setting these values as relative path names can cause compilation errors.

	There are several places you can set these values (in order of preference):

	* from ../env.properties in the main Flex source directory. See ../env-template.properties for details.
	* from shell environment variables.
	* from ./local.properties in the Mustella main directory. See ./local-template.properties. This file can set or override 
	the environment variables as well as setting Mustella-specific values. 


Trust Files
===========

	Before running any tests, be sure to set up the Flash Player trust configuration. Create or edit a file called
	dev.trust.cfg and add a line for the full path to the Mustella tests directory according to your platform. This will make the Flash
	Player trust all SWFs in that directory structure.

	Mac OS X location: /Library/Application Support/Macromedia/FlashPlayerTrust

		example: /Users/YourUser/apache/flex/mustella/tests

	Windows XP location: C:\Documents and Settings\YourUser\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player\#Security\FlashPlayerTrust

		example: c:\apache\flex\mustella\tests
	
	Windows 7 location: C:\Users\YourUser\AppData\Roaming\Macromedia\Flash Player\#Security\FlashPlayerTrust

		example: c:\cygwin\home\YourAccount\apache\flex\mustella\tests

Basic Commands
==============

	Run Mustella tests from the mustella directory using the mini_run.sh script. Windows users must use a 
	Unix-compatible shell application. The mini_run.sh script produces console output, results.txt (for the list of tests that
	pass), and failures.txt (for the list of tests that fail); but passes and failures are also reported on the console log.

		./mini_run.sh -all

	This command will run all of the tests.

		./mini_run.sh -failures

	This command will run all of the tests reported in failures.txt; tests that fail will 'timed out' will not be re-run, however.

		./mini_run.sh tests/components/Label

	This command will run just the tests in the components/Label test directory.

		./mini_run.sh -caseName=datagrid_properties_columns_0 tests/components/DataGrid/DataGrid_SparkSkin/Properties/datagrid_properties_columns.mxml

	This command runs a specific test case from a specific test file.

Alternate Location of Test Files
================================
	You can create Mustella tests for your own components and put them in your own test directory outside of the Flex SDK and Mustella source directories. To do this set the MUSTELLA_TEST_DIR environment variable to the absolute path of the directory containing your tests. Your test directory will need to include the exclude files (ExcludeList*.txt) for the platforms you are testing on but the files may be empty if you have no tests to exclude. After setting MUSTELLA_TEST_DIR, mini_run.sh will look in the new directory for tests to run instead of the 'tests' subdirectory of mustella.

	To support finding the location of the exclude file during test execution some changes to a test scriptâ€™s init() method are required. The requirement is the UnitTester.mustellaTestDir property must be set to the url of the test directory. Below is code that sets UnitTester.mustellaTestDir using a relative path from the test script.

            import mx.core.FlexGlobals;
            import mx.utils.LoaderUtil;
            
            public static function init(o:DisplayObject):void
            {
                // Set the directory where the exclude file loads.
                var url:String =  LoaderUtil.createAbsoluteURL(o.loaderInfo.url, "../../../");
                if (!url)
                    throw new Error("could not find mustella test directory");

                if (url.charAt(url.length - 1) == "/")
                    url = url.substring(0, url.length - 1);
      
                mustellaTestDir = url;
            }
