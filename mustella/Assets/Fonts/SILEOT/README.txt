TIPS
====

We do not offer technical support. The font has, however, been through 
some testing on various platforms to be sure it works in most situations. 

If you do find a problem, please do report it to <fonts AT sil DOT org>.
We can't guarantee any direct response, but will try to fix reported bugs in 
future versions. 

Many problems can be solved, or at least explained, through an understanding 
of the encoding and use of the fonts. Here are some basic hints:

Encoding: 
The fonts are encoded according to Unicode, so your application must support
Unicode text in order to access letters other than the standard alphabet.  Most
applications provide basic Unicode support. However, since Hebrew is a
right-to-left script your application must also support right-to-left behavior.
In addition, the application must support OpenType to get correct diacritic
placement.

Encoding Conversion:
Some TECkit mappings are provided for text conversion between legacy and Unicode.
Unicode-Ezra-Chart17short.pdf provides a Unicode chart.

Keyboarding on Windows:
For information on the provided Keyman keyboard layout, print 
Ezra SIL Keyboard Chart23.pdf. The Keyman program is available from
http://www.tavultesoft.com.

For detailed installation instructions, print the installation
guide: Keying in Hebrew.pdf or go to 
http://scripts.sil.org/KeyboardInstallationAndUse 
and select Keyman Install from the table of contents, if you are using the 
Keyman keyboard.

Another Windows keyboard is an MSKLC keyboard provided by The 
Society of Biblical Literature. It can be found here: 
http://www.sbl-site.org/Resources/Resources_BiblicalFonts.aspx

Keyboarding on Linux:
For information on the dedicated keyboard layout, see KMFL
(http://kmfl.sourceforge.net) and the corresponding kmfl-keyboard-SIL-Ezra
package.

Typographic Features:
You should expect to get the same typographic features and diacritic 
placement as is found in the printed Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia 1967/77, 1983. 
If you require a different style of typography, you should use a different font
or you may make your own, under the terms of the OFL. Please do not request of
us changes to the font that are not found in the BHS.

Source files:
Sources for Ezra SIL are provided in the source package and on the website.
The FontLab .vfb sources are available under the OFL and the VOLT .vtp sources
for the Hebrew layout intelligence are provided under the MIT/X11 license.
