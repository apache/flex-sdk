==================================================================
dataGroup_itemRemoveHandler(event:ElementExistenceEvent):void
- We can't verify that the event listener was removed, because
an ToggleButton has a click anyway.  The IEventDispatcher API
does not provide a way to ensure that the specific listener which
we added is no longer present, and since ButtonBar registered
a private method to be called on click, we can't override it
and check to see if it got called.

So re-add the button as a child for the app and click on it.
If the code is working right, then the ButtonBar won't respond.
If the code is working wrong, then the ButtonBar should err
when clicking this button because it is not in the bar anymore.
