<!-- Warning: Illustrator CS4 doesn't render Graphics with LinearGradientStroke. Okay in FXG Viewer -->

<!-- FXG 1.0 Test Stroke a path with LinearGradientStroke                    -->
<!-- The LinearGradientStroke paints a stroke along a path or shape with a continuously smooth color transition between a list of colors along a vector. 

The LinearGradientStroke operates almost identically to the LinearGradient fill type. As with the fill, By default, a LinearGradientStroke is transformed to fill the bounding box of the path being stroked. The bounding box is computed by computing the bounding box of the anchor points of the path, and expanding its borders outward in each direction by half the weight of the stroke.

Otherwise its rendering behavior is identical to that of the LinearGradientFill.
