<!-- Warning: Illustrator CS4 doesn't render RadialGradientStroke. FXG Viewer does.                                                                                		-->
<!-- FXG 1.0 Test Radial Gradient strokes a shape with interpolationMethod.                   -->
<!-- The RadialGradientStroke element paints a stroke along a path or shape with a continuously smooth color transition between a list of colors along the radius of a circle.

The RadialGradientStroke operates almost identically to the RadialGradient fill type. As with the fill, by default a RadialGradientStroke is transformed to fill the bounding box of the path being stroked. The bounding box is computed by computing the bounding box of the anchor points of the path, and expanding its borders outward in each direction by half the weight of the stroke.

Otherwise its rendering behavior is identical to that of the RadialGradientFill.
