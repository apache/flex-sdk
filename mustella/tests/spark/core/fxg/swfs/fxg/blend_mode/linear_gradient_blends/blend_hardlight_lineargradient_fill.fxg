<!-- Adjusts the color of each pixel based on the darkness of the element. If the element is lighter than 50% gray, the element and background colors are screened, which results in a lighter color. If the element is darker than 50% gray, the colors are multiplied, which results in a darker color. This setting is commonly used for shading effects.                                                                                 -->
