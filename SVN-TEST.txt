"I love work; it fascinates me; I can sit and watch it for hours." -- Jerome K. Jerome
It is COLD today in Boston!
It is RAINY today in Seattle!
Apathy - i could take it or leave it.

(you have to listen to this being recited by Douglas Campbell in Loreena McKennit's Lullaby song)

Oh for a voice like Thunder, and a tongue to drown the voice of war,
When the soul is driven to madness, 
WHO CAN STAND ?
When the souls of the oppressed fight in the troubled air that rages, 
WHO CAN STAND ?
When the whirlwind of fury comes from the throne of GOD, 
WHO CAN STAND ?
When the frowns of his countenance drive the nations together, 
WHO CAN STAND?
When sin claps his broad wings over the battle, and sails rejoicing in the flood of death,
When the souls are torn to everlasting fire, and fiends of Hell rejoice upon the slain,
Oh who can stand?
Oh who has caused this?
Oh who can answer at the throne of God?
The Kings and Nobles of the land have done it, 
Hear it not Heaven,
Thy Ministers have done it !

William Blake
